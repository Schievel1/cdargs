Dan Allen <dan_at_mojavelinux.com>
For more feedback and suggestions from the world 
(on version 1.14 and the following).
He wanted:
- mutt/vim style keybindings for movement
- resolving the list if only one entry
- from other requests the Needle magic was born
- don't use A_BOLD for highlighting of current entry
  (I took A_STANDOUT instead)
- ask user for a description and remove capitalize in default
- adding of entries from the command line.
- AND MUCH MORE...

Plus he found most of the bugs and he provided the bash shell
functions (check out the completion with cv [TAB]!!)!  
This was most valuable input, Dan. 




Damjan Lango <damjan.lango_at_hermes.si>
    first feedback from the world wishing two features:
    - history
    - add function to add to the list current directory, not only 
      the selected. 




Tomi Ollila <Tomi.Ollila_at_sonera.com>
For more feedback and suggestions from the world
- return code != null for quitting
- suggested introducing configurable keymaps



Stephen Gildea and Juhapekka Tolvanen <juhtolv_at_st.jyu.fi>
for corrections with quoting and portability of the shell functions.


Oron Pered for correcting my asumptions about the backticks and
terminal/curses things. I'm pretty sure that I'll use that in an
upcoming project :). Plus the .spec file and instructions how to use
it to build the RPM package.



R"udiger Goetz <http://www.r-goetz.de> for tcsh completion


Petra Malik <Petra.Malik_at_xtra.co.nz> for the Debian packaging and
bugfixes. 
Robi Malik <robi.malik_at_nexgo.de> for improvements to the bash completion
code.


Richard Lammers <Richard.Lammers_at_unh.edu> for highlight current
directory in list feature idea and much more feedback

Randy Chamberlin <littlemanrkc_at_subdimension.com> for whitespaces in
paths (and descriptions) bug report

Maximiliano Pin for suggestions to the user interface and bug
reporting.


Oscar Fernandez Sierra <oscar_at_el-mundo.net> for the patch that enables
a variable width/length for the description (in contrast to the
hardcoded 8 before that)


Miki Tebeka <miki.tebeka_at_zoran.com> and Claus for the Cygwin things.

Geert Jan Bex <http://uhasselt.be/~gjb> for changes to
cdargs-bash.sh 

Damon Harper <ds+dev-cdargs_at_usrbin.ca> for subdirectory completion
in bash.


Peace and Pleasure to you all!
