	I started this project and whenever there is an
	I-narrator it's me :).

Claus Brunzema    <mail@cbrunzema.de>
	Cleaned the code, gave hints, is user no.2
	introduced autoconf/automake and m4 to this
	project and more...

Kelly Anderon <kelly@xilka.com>
	Version 2.0 (functionally equivalent to 1.35)
	Major revamp to cleanup code and modernize the C++ implementation.
	Requires C++11 support.
	Converted to Meson/Ninja build system, autoconf was always so slow/ugly/messy.
