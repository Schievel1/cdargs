2006-03-03  Stefan Kamphausen  <http://www.skamphausen.de>

	* configure.in:  Version 1.35

	* contrib/cdargs-bash.sh: Minor bugfix from Damon when completing
	the second subdirectory. 

2006-03-02  Stefan Kamphausen  <http://www.skamphausen.de>

	* configure.in: Version 1.34

	* contrib/cdargs-bash.sh: Many changes to make completion work
	with subdirectories from Damon.

2006-02-26  Stefan Kamphausen  <http://www.skamphausen.de>

	* src/cdargs.cc: applied patch from Claus for empty lines in
	bookmark file.

	* THANKS: Added Damon.
	Changed email adresses to contain _at_ instead of the real at.

2005-11-12  Stefan Kamphausen  <http://www.skamphausen.de>

	* src/cdargs.cc(edit_list_file): Quoted filename.

2005-11-06  Stefan Kamphausen  <http://www.skamphausen.de>

	* cdargs.spec.in: Fixes by Oron:
	  - s/Copyright/License/
	  - Install the contrib/*.{csh,sh} into /etc/profile.d/ instead
            of the documentation directory -- so they are usable to all.
          - Used the %configure macro (standard in RedHat and Mandriva --
            what about Suse?).
          - Used DESTDIR for installation (standard in automake generated
            Makefiles).

	* contrib/cdargs-tcsh.csh: Changed path of csh.  Actually one
	should remove the path because the file must be sourced anyway.
	Anyway... 

2005-10-09  Stefan Kamphausen  <http://www.skamphausen.de>

	* configure.in: Version 1.32

	* README: email to website....

	* cdargs.spec.in (Vendor): email to website....

	* AUTHORS: email to website....

	* src/cdargs.cc: Removed references to my email address.  Use
	domain instead.

2005-10-01  Stefan Kamphausen  <http://www.skamphausen.de>

	* THANKS: added Geert

	* contrib/cdargs-bash.sh: Patch by Geert: more quotes and the
	sed-statement will use the first space as separater, not the last.

2005-01-04  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * INSTALL: signing with detached signature added.

2004-12-30  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

	* configure.in: New curses M4, version 1.31

	* src/cdargs.cc(list_to_file): Creating backup now.
	(toggle_mode): Fixed a long standing bug in which you could loose
	almost all your bookmarks when toggling the mode with a needle
	defined. 

	* autogen.sh (SRCDIR): New curses M4, no "." in PATH

	* m4/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): New curses M4

	* src/Makefile.am (LDADD): New curses M4

	* THANKS: Added Miki and Claus for Cygwinification

	* src/cdargs.cc(user_interaction): opt_no_resolve works in
	LIST-mode, too. 

2004-03-31  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

	* configure.in: Version 1.29
	
	* INSTALL (Appendix): typo, add signing instruction - mainly for
	myself. 

	* doc/cdargs.1: New PgKey-behaviour.

	* src/cdargs.cc(user_interaction): opt_noresolv now works in LIST
	mode.  PageKeys now scroll the list and not the shortcut numbers,
	which was kinda stupid anyway.  Note, however, the we don't scroll
	in screenfulls but in 10's because this is better in terminals
	that are vertically large, because a screenfull of scrolling
	wouldn't do anything there.  In addition this scrolling won't wrap
	around.
	The adjust_shorties_offset function was removed from the sources.
	(helpscreen): New PgKey-behaviour

2003-12-22  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

	* THANKS: changed email adress of Petra

2003-12-18  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc: removed get_current_dir_name() and wrote two new
        functions (get_cwd_as_charp) and (get_cwd_as_string).  All this to
        overcome a bug when trying to do anything in a directory that had
        been removed in the meantime.  Now we just exit in such a case.
        This also involves another checkpoint in (list_from_dir) where an
        exit was picked instead of going one directory up.  It took me
        hours to even track that bug down!  You nasty, you!

2003-06-05  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * configure.in: Version 1.27

        * src/cdargs.cc: renamed (abort) to (abort_cdargs) according to
        debian bug and bugfix by Petra Malik. 

        * src/cdargs.h: renamed (abort) to (abort_cdargs) ...

2003-02-23  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * configure.in: Version 1.26

        * contrib/cdargs.el (cdargs-warped-hook): added hint with desktop
        check in docstring 

        * cdargs.spec.in: (re)added cdargs.el, which I had put into
        cdargs.spec. 

        * contrib/cdargs.el: added installation

        * THANKS: added Oscar

        * INSTALL: Describe the variable width settings.

        * src/cdargs.cc: Applied patch by Oscar to get a description of
        variable length. Changed that code again to have the length fixed
        for browse mode.

2003-02-16  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * contrib/cdargs.el: added cdargs-warped-hook, changed the file
        parser from a quite perlish to a more elispish way.
        
2003-02-13  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc(list_from_dir): when coming to a directory which
        hadn't been visited before, using ".." make the previous directory
        the current directory.

2003-02-11  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * configure.in: Version 1.24

        * src/cdargs.cc: several code cleanups, fixed the handling of a
        digit-Needle again.
        
        * src/cdargs.cc(terminate): print a bug report request on
        SIGSEGV. 
        

        * doc/cdargs.1: updated keys in list mode in the COMMANDS
        section. 

        * src/cdargs.cc(user_interaction): swapping/transposing entries
        now has its own function which can also proceed the
        current position afterwards: swap_two_entries. New commands m and
        M move an entry up or down and move the position, too.

        (helpscreen): new commands: m and M.

        (swap_two_entries): new.

        * doc/cdargs.1: opt_cwd ...

        * src/cdargs.cc(display_list): bugfix with longer pathnames than
        displayed.  

        (main, list_from_file, global): added opt_cwd which activates the
        current working directory as the current entry on startup.

2003-02-10  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * INSTALL (Example): added cdargs.el

        * doc/cdargs.1 (mode): added cdargs.el

        * contrib/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): added cdargs.el

        * cdargs.spec (Buildroot): added cdargs.el

        * cdargs.el: NEW
        
2003-02-08  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc(helpscreen): using PAGER instead of self-rolled
        help-window.  

2003-02-06  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * configure.in: Version 1.23

        * doc/cdargs.1: added DISPLAY section.

        * src/cdargs.cc(display_list): added marking of list entries that
        point to no valid directories [using a '!' in front of the path]
        and have a list item which is equal to the current working
        directory stand out in bold font.
        
        (list_from_file): changed the reading routine to correctly detect
        descriptions and paths with whitespaces.

2003-02-04  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * configure.in: Version 1.22

        * src/cdargs.cc(edit_list_file): honored Debians /usr/bin/editor
        preference by stat()ing it. 

        * contrib/cdargs-bash.sh: Changed completion code improver from
        Jochen to Robi: Jochen _detected_ and Robi (partly) solved the
        bug. 

2003-02-02  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc(terminate): different way to shut up the compiler
        that may be cleaner?
        
        (resizeevent) dto.

2003-01-30  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.h: copyright -2003

        * src/cdargs.cc: copyright -2003

        * doc/cdargs.1 (bash): more small fixes by Petra and spell
        checking. 
                

        * contrib/cdargs-bash.sh (_cdargs_aliases): more bugfixes by
        Jochen Voss.

2003-01-27  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc (toggle_mode): added yoffset = 0 to avoid
        segfaults. This really feels ugly and makes me feel like rewriting
        the whole thing even more... 

        * contrib/cdargs-bash.sh (_cdargs_aliases): fixed the slash bug
        found and solved by Jochen Voss <voss@debian.org> with the general
        problem of special characters still lurking there at the
        unprepared user.

        * doc/cdargs.1: small fixes by Petra Malik, extended copyright
        notice to 2003. 

2002-04-27  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc: (list_to_file) no writing when a user was given
        as option.

        (main) new options: --file, --user and --output [f,u,o] to change
        bookmarks and output files.

        (list_from_file) uses new get_listfile()

        (edit_list_file) uses new get_listfile()

        (get_resultfile) new function

        (get_listfile) new function

        (usage) described new options

        * doc/cdargs.1: Description of --file and --user and --output added

        * contrib/cdargs-bash.sh: re-introduced the logical AND when
        changing directories with cdargs (function cdb) 

2002-04-15  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * cdargs.spec.in: Added RPM spec-file written by Oron Peled. 

        * INSTALL: described new tcsh file.

        * doc/cdargs.1: described new tcsh file and added an extra not
        about the shell completion.

        * contrib/cdargs-tcsh.sh: added file

2002-04-12  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc: (list_from_dir) added sorting of list.

2002-04-10  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc: (list_from_dir) fixed long listing revisited lost
        highlighter problem - hopefully.

2002-04-09  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * configure.in: Version 1.19.

        * (user_interaction) added vi-keybindings for HOME and END.
        Moved offset handling when current position leaves the screen to
        cur_pos_add(). 

        (cur_pos_add) see above.

        (visible) new function. Tests whether the given position is
        visible on the screen.
        
2002-04-05  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * contrib/cdargs-bash.sh (_cdargs_exec): set last to empty string
        if the last argument is an existing file, which means that no
        alias/description was given. Start in browse mode then. 

        * src/cdargs.cc: Made the appearance of "." and ".." more
        consistent with common un*x practice and more intuitive.

        Added --browse/-b option to start in browse mode. Since the
        optional argument handling in getopt_long() seems to be a GNU
        extension and someday I want to compile on other unices I don't
        enable it here - it always starts with the current directory.

2002-04-04  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * THANKS: Added Oron Pered. 

        * README: Noted the TTY-code I got from Oron Pered.

        * doc/cdargs.1: Edited key labels like in (helpscreen) and added
        the Emacs-style bindings.

        * src/cdargs.cc: (init_curses) added code line for better handling
        of cursor - effectively of not showing any cursor at all.

        (helpscreen) removed alternative keybindings (now in manpage) and
        corrected the key labels from 'left' to '<LEFT>'. 

        (user_interaction) added many many emacs-style keybindings and
        TERMINFO compile tests - inspired from cscope source :-). Thank
        you!
        
        (toggle_mode) disable Needle and reread list from file when
        entering LIST mode, which should only happen when someone presses
        TAB twice.

        (finish) clearing screen because terminals like aterm let the list
        be displayed after finishing. I think this is wasted screen-room
        so remove it.

2002-04-03  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * doc/cdargs.1: Described PageUp and PageDown.

        * src/cdargs.cc: The existance of a Needle is not checked by
        pointer but by size of Needle-string; this fixes a bug when called
        like cdargs "" which would never save the list.

        Somehow connected to this is the disabling of
        deleting/adding/editing of the list when no saving will take
        place. Find the tests for 'NeedleGiven'. 

        Added PAGE_UP and PAGE_DN keys to move the Shortcut Digits
        This probably shows up everywhere where you can find a
        'shorties_offset' variable. Added this to (helpscreen)
        
        Corrected the positioning of active entry when deleting inside the
        list and not the last entry.

        Changed (cur_pos_add) to (cur_pos_adjust).

        
        
        
2002-04-01  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * doc/cdargs.1: Behaviour of numbers, not saving the list when
        Needle is given. Changed the size of the description field from 15
        to 9 (and hold your thumbs that we don't have to recalc some
        things from that).

        * src/cdargs.cc: Pressing numbers in BROWSE mode just makes that
        the current position, not resolving anymore in
        (user_interaction). 
        Fixes for reading and writing of bookmarks file when the list
        and/or the file is empty in (list_to_file) and (list_from_file).
        A small fix for the Current Position when it is somewhere outside
        the displayable list in (display_list).
        Show the current mode in (update_modeline).
        Reflect changes in (helpscreen).
        
        * contrib/cdargs-bash.sh: Check for existance of ~/.cdargs in
        function _cdargs_get_dir. Enabled _both_ cv and cb as an alias to
        the formal cdb.

2002-03-31  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>


        * doc/cdargs.1: Reflect one-entry-bookmark-file behaviour.
        Tell about the new bash functions. 
        
        * contrib/cdargs-bash.sh: New in the distribution. A few changes
        to the version of Dan: cv instead of cb and added function ca
        which does not mess with the bookmarks file. Improved creation of
        a tempfile using PID and a RANDOM number from the kernel for
        filename. 

        * src/cdargs.cc: (cur_pos_add) Added a wraparound option (default
        true) in addition to the --nowrap option from the commandline.
        (delete_from_default_list) fixed a bug with CurrentPosition when
        deleting the last entry.
        (list_from_file) Counting lines and if only one entry we show the
        list in any case.

2002-03-30  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * doc/cdargs.1: Describe the Needle magic and the new option
        --noresolve.
        Description of the --add=[:desc:]path syntax.

        * src/cdargs.cc: Some more Needle magic: if it matches a
        description exactly that is taken unless the (new) command line
        option  --noresolve was given. Reflect this in helpscreen.

2002-03-29  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc(last_dirname): Fixed behaviour when there is a
        trailing slash. 
        (add_to_list_file): Only allowing absolute paths.
        Adding new colon-description-syntax to allow passing of
        descriptions from command line.
        An empty string from user-interaction quits the adding of a path
        to the list. 
        (list_from_dir): Removed capitalization of dirnames.
        Added empty directory listing: ".." and ".".

2002-03-28  Stefan Kamphausen  <kamphausen@novelscience.com>

        * src/cdargs.cc: Updated docs: mainly shell functions stuff; in
        helpscreen() and in usage().

        * doc/cdargs.1: Updated docs: mainly shell functions stuff. 

        * INSTALL: Updated docs: mainly shell functions stuff. 

        * THANKS: Added Juhapekka Tolvanen.

2002-03-27  Stefan Kamphausen  <kamphausen@novelscience.com>

        * doc/Makefile.am: brandnew and exciting: cdargs now comes with a
        manpage :-) 

        * doc/cdargs.1: Wrote manpage. Probably this need reworking.

        * src/cdargs.cc: Added '?' as a key to call for help, added the
        keys 'A' and 'C' that work just like their lowercase equivalents
        (i.e. adding directories to the list) but ask the user to enter a
        description string. Reflect this in helpscreen() and fix a bug in
        helpscreen to really display all the help.

2002-03-26  Stefan Kamphausen  <kamphausen@novelscience.com>

        * src/cdargs.cc: Suggestions by Dan Allen: vim/mutt-style
        keybindings, i.e. h/l for left right and k/j for up/down. 
        The currently selected list entry is not displayed with attribute
        A_BOLD but A_STANDOUT (which is the best highlighting mode of the
        current terminal and I hope this works well).
        Plus if the list to display (in LIST mode) contains only one entry
        (usually due to filtering it) cdargs exits with that entry as the
        result. 
        Reflect this in helpscreen, too.

2002-03-20  Stefan Kamphausen  <kamphausen@novelscience.com>

        * src/cdargs.cc: Version 1.14. Added capitalized_last_dirname
        function which e.g. is used to insert a default description when
        adding paths to the default list.

2002-02-02  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc: Version 1.13. New hotkeys: '/' and '~' which
        switch to browse mode and show the root or home directory. Fixed a
        bug with filenames in the root directory. Changed email adress
        from corporate to private.

2002-01-14  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc: when Needle (search pattern) is integer the
        current position is set accordingly.

2001-10-02  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc: cleaned up code formatting

        * src/cdargs.h: cleaned up code formatting

2001-09-28  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * configure.in: version 1.11

        * THANKS: Added Thanks to Tomi Ollila

        * INSTALL: changed function to use return code

        * src/cdargs.cc: cdargs now has a reasonable return code. So you
        can use a better shell function. Wrote that to docs, too

2001-09-27  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * configure.in: version 1.1

        * THANKS: Added Thanks to Damjan Lango

        * src/cdargs.cc: Fixed a bug when adding a directory to a file
        from the command line: it always added CWD because cur_list is
        empty. Now this test only takes place when the (n)curses enginge
        is running. 

2001-09-26  Stefan Kamphausen  <mail@skamphausen.de>

        * src/cdargs.cc: - added 'c' key to insert current directory
                         - fixed a coredump in curses when adding a
                           directory from the command line
                         - rearranged the help screen for small terminal
                         - fixed a missing 'break' in user_interaction
                           which caused your listfile to shring when
                           viewing the helpscreen                          
                         - added history (using a C++ map) so that
                           the current position is set when you re-enter
                           an already visited directory.
