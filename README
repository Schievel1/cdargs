* Description: 
 Keep you hotspots of the filesystem in a bookmark list and warp there
 easily or browse the filesystem with a few fast keystrokes.

 inspired by the CDBM script written by Michael Schili for the german
 iX-Magazin and the derived scripts in the discussion thread to that
 script.  This is a complete rewrite of the whole thing in C++ with a
 bunch of features added to it.

 For an explanation see file INSTALL, start cdargs:
