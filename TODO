TODO List for cdargs
Time-stamp: <17-Feb-2003 20:41:53 ska>

Bugs
====

1. TAB Completion with (for awk) special characters
   I'd even extent this to the general shell plugin and completion:
   - option -u[--user] works with the binary but not with the shell
     plugin
   - AWK compreply generation
     I'd like to see common cd completion when a bookmark could be
     resolved (of course the binary had to act in an appropriate way)


These are the things on my personal ToDo List for this leetle
project:

[ ] Spacers in the list?

[ ] TOTAL REWRITE FROM SCRATCH for cleaner design and code!
    I'd really to see this done, but alas! who's got the time for it? 
[ ] new keys to scroll long directory listings (SPACE and BACKSPACE or
    should SPACE be finish-using-the-currently-shown-directory ?
[ ] search modus: in BROWSE mode it would be quite cool to just type
    '/ et' and automatically end up in the etc directory.
[ ] automatic installation of shell script files and add a line to
    source them at the end of ~/.bashrc? Well, maybe
[ ] Fix everything for different terminals than xterm;
	Example: in (some version of) konsole KEY_HOME and KEY_END don't
	work properly
[ ] And when that is done I WANT COLORS ($LS_COLORS...)!
[?] The Legal Stuff
[?] Some good ideas for the User Interface anybody?

[ ] remove the GNU_SOURCES to be compilable on other platforms?

Here come the things I probably (or definetly) won't do myself.
Feel free to get into the game

[ ] Internationalization
[ ] the usual security flaws (buffer, printf, whatever)
[ ] compile, run, test on various platforms (I have only linux boxes)
[x] make a debian package - thanks to Petra Malik
[ ] fix m4 macro setup (make barfs if you change configure.in. you
    have to run autogen.sh in this case).

Explanation:
===========
[ ] open subject
[x] done (and will be removed later)
[?] is this OK yet? (maybe needs some debugging)
[-] action cancelled
